## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project (for backend functionality)
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd clockistry
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Run the setup script to create your environment file:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-env
   ```
   
   Then update the `.env.local` file with your actual Firebase configuration:
   ```bash
   # Firebase Configuration
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project_id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   
   ```

   For AI features, add your OpenAI key to the backend `.env` (server-side only):
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```
   
   **Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application
