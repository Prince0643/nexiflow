Phase 1: Preparation and Setup
1. Environment Configuration
 Verify .env.local contains correct MySQL connection settings
 Confirm database connection is working in all environments
 Update any deployment scripts to include MySQL configuration
2. Codebase Audit
 Identify all files that import Firebase services
 Map Firebase service usage to equivalent MySQL services
 Document real-time features that need alternative implementations


Phase 2: Service Layer Transition
3. Time Entry Service Transition
 Replace timeEntryService imports with mysqlTimeEntryService
 Update function calls to match MySQL service signatures
 Test time tracking functionality (start/stop timer, edit entries)
 Verify dashboard statistics and reporting
4. User Service Transition
 Replace userService imports with mysqlUserService
 Update user management screens (create, edit, delete users)
 Verify authentication flows still work correctly
 Test role-based access controls
5. Project Service Transition
 Replace projectService imports with mysqlProjectService
 Update project and client management functionality
 Verify project creation, editing, and archiving
 Test client management features
6. Team Service Considerations
 Evaluate if teamService needs MySQL equivalent
 Create mysqlTeamService if needed or adapt existing Firebase service
 Test team creation, member management, and permissions


Phase 3: Real-Time Feature Replacement
7. Dashboard Updates
 Replace Firebase real-time listeners with periodic polling or WebSocket solution
 Implement manual refresh options for critical data
 Optimize data fetching to minimize database load
8. Notification System
 Adapt notificationService for MySQL backend
 Implement polling mechanism for real-time updates
 Consider WebSocket implementation for instant notifications


Phase 4: Component Updates
9. Time Tracking Components
 Update TimeTracker component to use MySQL services
 Modify timer display and controls
 Test time entry creation and management
10. User Management Components
 Update admin dashboard user lists
 Modify user creation and editing modals
 Test user role assignments and permissions
11. Project Management Components
 Update project and client listing pages
 Modify project creation and editing forms
 Test project assignment and filtering
12. Team Management Components
 Update team listing and detail views
 Modify team member management interfaces
 Test team-based permissions and access


Phase 5: Data Synchronization and Consistency
13. Data Validation
 Implement input validation for all forms
 Add error handling for database operations
 Create user-friendly error messages
14. Caching Strategy
 Implement caching for frequently accessed data
 Add cache invalidation mechanisms
 Optimize data loading performance


Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
15. Unit Testing
 Update existing unit tests for MySQL services
 Write new tests for MySQL-specific functionality
 Ensure test coverage meets quality standards
16. Integration Testing
 Test end-to-end workflows with MySQL backend
 Verify data consistency across related entities
 Test edge cases and error scenarios
17. Performance Testing
 Benchmark query performance
 Optimize slow database queries
 Test application under load


Phase 7: Deployment Preparation
18. Database Optimization
 Review and optimize database indexes
 Analyze query execution plans
 Implement connection pooling if not already done
19. Monitoring and Logging
 Set up database monitoring
 Implement application logging
 Create alerts for critical issues
20. Backup Strategy
 Establish regular database backup schedule
 Test backup restoration procedures
 Document disaster recovery process


Phase 8: Gradual Rollout
21. Feature Flag Implementation
 Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
 Create toggle between Firebase and MySQL backends
 Enable selective feature testing
22. Staged Deployment
 Deploy to staging environment first
 Conduct thorough testing with test users
 Monitor performance and stability metrics
23. Production Rollout
 Begin with limited user group
 Gradually increase user base
 Monitor system closely during transition

 
Phase 9: Post-Transition Activities
24. Firebase Cleanup
 Archive Firebase data (retain for 30 days)
 Remove Firebase dependencies from package.json
 Clean up unused Firebase configuration
25. Documentation Updates
 Update technical documentation
 Create MySQL-specific guides
 Document new deployment procedures
26. Team Training
 Train development team on MySQL services
 Update onboarding documentation
 Share best practices for MySQL development
